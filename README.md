# RoastMeme

My project 3 is an app that showcases users who are willing to be "roasted". After a user signs-up, they will be amongst other displayed users on the homepage, where any other user is then able to look at a profile and search a meme to generate. The generated meme should be a "jab" towards the user. These memes will be then be displayed on the user's profile for others to see.
